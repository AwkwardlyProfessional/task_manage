# Answers to Technical Questions

## 1. How long did you spend on the coding test?

I spent approximately **4-5 hours** working on the coding test. This time was used for:

- Understanding the requirements and setting up the environment.
- Writing the application code (Flask + SQLAlchemy).
- Testing and debugging the application.
- Implementing additional features like user authentication, task management, and email alerts.
- Adding basic validation and handling errors.

## 2. What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.

The most useful feature in the latest version of Python that I used is **f-string formatting**, which was introduced in Python 3.6. It provides a more concise and readable way to format strings, making code cleaner and easier to maintain.

### Code Snippet Example:

```python
name = "John"
age = 30

# Using f-string for string interpolation
greeting = f"Hello, my name is {name} and I am {age} years old."
print(greeting)
